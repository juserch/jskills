# Forge Changelog

All notable per-skill version bumps for the [forge](https://github.com/juserai/forge) skill collection.

Format inspired by [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versioning follows [SemVer 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Bump triggers are defined in [openspec/specs/skill-lifecycle/spec.md](openspec/specs/skill-lifecycle/spec.md).

Detailed rationale for each entry lives under `openspec/changes/<id>/` (active or archived). This file is a navigation index — read the change record for the full design context.

> Lint contract: `skill-lint` rule **S31** enforces that each skill's frontmatter `version` MUST equal the latest `### [X.Y.Z]` heading under that skill's section here. PRs that bump SKILL.md frontmatter without adding a CHANGELOG entry will be blocked.

## Forge collection (集合级)

> Collection-level `plugin.json` version policy is intentionally NOT defined in this changelog yet — see [openspec/changes/archive/version-governance/proposal.md § Non-goals](openspec/changes/archive/version-governance/proposal.md). A follow-up RFC will govern when collection-level version bumps happen and how they relate to per-skill bumps. Until then, `plugin.json` and `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` remain at `1.0.0` per [openspec/specs/repo-invariants/spec.md § Plugin metadata 双份一致](openspec/specs/repo-invariants/spec.md).
